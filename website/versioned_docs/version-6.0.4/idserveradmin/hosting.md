# Hosting

The different ways to host the Admin UI are very similar to those used for the Identity Server itself. If you're already familiar with the deployment strategies for the Identity Server, you'll find that the same principles apply here.

For detailed guidance on setup, configuration, and hosting scenarios, we recommend referring to the [corresponding chapters](../idserver/hosting/iis.md) that cover Identity Server hosting. They provide all the necessary instructions and best practices that can be directly reused or adapted for the Admin UI.

Whether you're deploying to a containerized environment, behind a reverse proxy, or in a cloud-native setup, the Admin UI can seamlessly integrate into your existing infrastructure.
