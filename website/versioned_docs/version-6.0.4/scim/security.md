# Security

By default, when a minimal version of the SCIM server is installed, none of the endpoints are secured. This means that, out of the box, all SCIM operations are publicly accessibleâ€”suitable for quick testing or prototyping, but not for production scenarios.

To protect SCIM endpoints using API keys, follow these steps:

## Install the Nuget Package

Add the `SimpleIdServer.Scim.ApiKeyAuth` package to your project. This package provides the middleware and configuration types needed to enforce API key authentication.

```batch title="cmd.exe"
dotnet add package SimpleIdServer.Scim.ApiKeyAuth
```

## Edit Program.cs

In your `Program.cs`, after registering SCIM with `AddScim()`, invoke the `EnableApiKeyAuth()` extension method. This method can be called with or without a parameter of type `ApiKeysConfiguration`.

```csharp title="Program.cs"
services.AddScim()
        .EnableApiKeyAuth()
```

**Without Parameters**: If you call `EnableApiKeyAuth()` without passing an `ApiKeysConfiguration` instance, the SCIM server will use a default set of API keys (see the table below).

**With ApiKeysConfiguration**: You may supply a custom **ApiKeysConfiguration** object that explicitly defines one or more realm-to-key mappings. Each key in the configuration corresponds to a "realm" that you have configured in SCIM. Incoming requests must present one of those valid keys in the Authorization: Bearer KEY header.
