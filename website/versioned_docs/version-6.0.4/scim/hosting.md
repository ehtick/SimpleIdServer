# Hosting

Deploying a SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) server is very similar to deploying an identity server. 
The methods, configurations, and best practices used for one are mostly applicable to the other. This similarity allows teams that have experience with identity server deployments to quickly adapt and deploy SCIM services.

For more detailed information, please refer to the [corresponding chapters](../idserver/hosting/iis.md) in your deployment documentation.
