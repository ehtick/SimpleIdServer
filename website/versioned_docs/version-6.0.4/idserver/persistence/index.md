# Introduction

SimpleIdServerâ€™s identity server stands as a robust solution designed to handle critical identity management tasks. At its core, the system utilizes a relational database to store and manage diverse types of data, ensuring both security and efficiency in the authentication ecosystem.

## Comprehensive Data Storage

The relational database architecture is carefully structured to accommodate various kinds of data essential for identity management. 
This includes:

* **Identity Server Data**: The database holds key information about the identity server itself. This encompasses user details, group memberships, and client configurations. Such data is fundamental for managing access control and ensuring that users are correctly authenticated before being granted access to services.

* **Graphical Elements for Authentication Forms**: Beyond traditional identity data, the system also stores the graphical elements that make up the authentication forms. By keeping the design components in the database, administrators can easily update and customize the visual aspects of login interfaces without disrupting the underlying authentication mechanisms.

* **Authentication and Registration Processes** : The workflow logic for both authentication and registration processes is managed within the database. This structured storage of processes allows for consistent and reliable handling of user login and account creation operations, enhancing the overall user experience.

* **Cryptographic Keys**: Security is paramount in any identity management system. The relational database is entrusted with storing cryptographic keys that are vital for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data, such as authentication cookies. By securing these keys within a robust database system, SimpleIdServer ensures that user sessions and data remain protected against unauthorized access.
