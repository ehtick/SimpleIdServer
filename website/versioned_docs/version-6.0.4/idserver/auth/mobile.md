# Mobile Authentication

Connecting to the identity server through our mobile application is a streamlined process. 
To get started, you first need to install the NuGet package `SimpleIdServer.IdServer.Fido`. 
This package is essential for enabling mobile authentication features within your server environment.

```bash  title="cmd.exe"
dotnet add package SimpleIdServer.IdServer.Fido
```

## Integrating the Package with Your Identity Server

Once the NuGet package is installed, the next step is to integrate it into your identity server. 
This is done by invoking the `AddMobileAuthentication` function from the fluent API. The function accepts two parameters:

1. **Configuration Override**: The first parameter allows you to override the default configuration settings for the [Fido2NetLib](https://github.com/passwordless-lib/fido2-net-lib) library.
2. **Default Authentication Method**: The second parameter specifies whether mobile authentication should be set as the default method for your identity server.

Below is a sample C# code snippet that demonstrates how to add mobile authentication to your server:

```csharp  title="Program.cs"
webApplicationBuilder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json")
    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{webApplicationBuilder.Environment.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables();
webApplicationBuilder.AddSidIdentityServer()
    .AddDeveloperSigningCredential()
    .AddInMemoryRealms(Config.Realms)
    .AddInMemoryUsers(Config.Users)
    .AddInMemoryLanguages(Config.Languages)
    .AddMobileAuthentication(null, true);

var app = webApplicationBuilder.Build();
app.Services.SeedData();
app.UseSid();
app.Run();
```

## Configuring Mobile Options

The mobile authentication library is configurable via the `appsettings.json` file. 
By adding a `MobileOptions` property, you can customize specific aspects of the authentication process. One key configuration is the expiration time for the QR code, controlled by the property:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| U2FExpirationTimeInSeconds | The validity duration of the QR code |

Here is an example configuration for appsettings.json:

```json title="appsettings.json"
"MobileOptions": {
    "U2FExpirationTimeInSeconds": "20"
}
```

## Mobile Application Availability

Our mobile application, designed to work as a FIDO device, is available on both iOS and Android platforms. Although it is no longer available on the App Store, users can still download it via Google Play:

[Download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simpleidserver.mobile&pcampaignid=web_share)

This application acts as a powerful authentication device, allowing users to leverage FIDO-based security measures for accessing the identity server.

## Authentication workflow

When users launch the mobile application, they are greeted by an intuitive authentication window. The first field is designated for entering the userâ€™s login credentials. After inputting their details, users can simply click on the `generate the qr code` button to produce a QR code that facilitates the authentication process.
